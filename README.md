# CaseModellingStep

A case where I show how I would approach the Modelling Step of a Binary Classifier.

The files you should find here:

- requirements.txt: I install these directly on the notebook with pip install, but they should help you to reproduce the code I'm running here. It just installs some libs that sometimes are not found on conda environments.
- scripts/
    - helper.py: Some custom transformers which will help me with the feature engineering step.
- model/
    - best_model.pickle: the best model I could achieve using this dataset.
- files/
    - labeled_transactions.csv: the dataset I'm using for this case.

Feel free to give me any sugestions and feedbacks!
